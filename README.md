# Election_Guides
Every election I put together a non-partisan, easy to read guide for people. Feel free to download and distribute. If you'd like a guide that isn't listed send me a message or email me at lizmuehlmann@gmail.com


There's also a "how would Liz vote" (aka leftist) version available by request.
